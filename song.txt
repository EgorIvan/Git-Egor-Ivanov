Some deny and search for things that never come around
Do I feel like a fool?
The places I have ran to all my life have disappeared
And I owe this all to you (all to you)
I'm feeling like I'm sinking
And nothing's there to catch me, keep me breathing (breathing)
What do I have to do?
Why can't this hurt be through?
I'm going head onto something I know I will fail
Why can't this kiss be true?
Why won't you please let me through?
I don't understand why you always push me away
The last thing I would like to do before I go away
Is cry there next to you (next to you)
Cry and talk about the good old days and where they've gone
And now how much I hate you
